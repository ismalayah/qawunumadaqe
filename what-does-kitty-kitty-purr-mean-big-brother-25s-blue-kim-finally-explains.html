Has it become as iconic as Rachel Reilly’s “Floaters, you better grab a life vest,” line during Big Brother 12? No. But is it as memorable? Maybe, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>Regardless, the 25-year-old brand strategist finally explained what her (catchy?) catchphrase means.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Blue placed seventh on Big Brother 25 after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she fell victim</a> to a blindside from her former BFF Jagateshwar “Jag” Bains — although he robbed viewers of her genuine reaction to it by telling her minutes before the live show began rolling.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Instead, we got a few “Kitty kitty purrs” before she left to join <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Wurtenberger</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Hardin</a> in the jury house.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>During her exit press rounds following her eviction on October 26, Blue was asked about her cat-fueled mantra. Big Brother 21 houseguest Kat (ironic?) Dunn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted to know</a>, and she shared the answer when speaking on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Bi Reality Podcast.</a></p><p>“Okay, basically ‘Kitty kitty boots down’ is a feeling, it’s a form of expression. Whenever you’re walking down with the cutest, hottest new outfit, ‘Kitty kitty purr.’ Whenever you just became valedictorian for your school, ‘Kitty kitty purr!’ Whenever you do anything slay, then ‘Kitty kitty purr boots down.’ And that’s exactly what it means. If you know, you know. And if you don’t, I’m sorry. You’re just not part of the gang.”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Well, now that you know, you can be a part of Blue’s gang. Who else is a part of it? Likely Blue’s friends and family, and potentially anyone else indoctrinated by her during her time in the limelight.</p><h2 id=h-blue-s-game-ended-in-a-not-very-kitty-kitty-purr-boots-down-kind-of-way data-injectable=false>Blue’s game ended in a not very ‘Kitty kitty purr boots down’ kind of way</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Without her knowing, Blue was Jag’s main target for two weeks. The two were extremely close allies at the start of the 100-day battle for $750,000. In week 4, Cameron recognized them as being a tight duo, and he nominated them together. Jag was ultimately evicted over Blue, but Matt secretly used a game-saving advantage — the “Power of Invincibility” — which nullified Jag’s eviction.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>After Jag survived the next eviction sitting beside Michael “Red” Utley, the 25-year-old truck company owner never touched the block again. And with Blue drifting closer to her showmance Jared, Jag established stronger game blonds with the likes of Matt Klotz and Bowie Jane Ball.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>When Jag won the invincible Head of Household in week 11, he decided it was time to serve Blue her walking papers. He nominated her for eviction alongside Felicia Cannon. But this time, a twist likely saved Blue. Two Power of Veto necklaces were up for grabs, and she won the second one (Jag captured the first), which postponed the inevitable.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Because of the invincible Head of Household twist, Jag was eligible to play for the private suite’s key at the start of week 12 as well. And after snagging the house’s top spot, he nominated Blue alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America Lopez</a>. He later won the Power of Veto and kept the two women on the block.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>For the entire week, Blue believed she was sitting pretty as the pawn, as Jag’s true intention was to eliminate the second half of “Americory.” But that wasn’t the case. Jag was clear with the remaining houseguests that he wanted Blue out, and they obliged.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Blue revealed during her post-eviction interview with host Julie Chen Moonves that Jag finally delivered the news to her right before the live show began airing on CBS Thursday night.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Live feed watchers were hoping Jag wouldn’t say anything to Blue. Big Brother 25 has been filled with unanimous evictions that have left fans begging for a blindside. Instead, Blue had time to dress up in her best attire while America wore sports clothing in anticipation of hanging around for the double eviction.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Luckily, Blue avoided a flopped “Kitty kitty purr” moment by finding out she was heading to Jury ahead of time.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>“The house was full of chaos — everybody was going to let me go see Julie Chen in a workout outfit which was disgraceful to me,” Blue said on the podcast. “I think the moments leading up to my eviction the house was full of craziness. But, it was everything that I expected Big Brother to be, I guess.”</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>Matt, Bowie Jane, Felicia, and Cirie Fields all threw their votes onto Blue, and she left out the front door as the eighth houseguest to fall via an unanimous decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2nlah6rLXTrbBmo5mpwbp5z66pq2Wdmq6vecGinmaaoqTBqbHRZmluq12XubaxjKSgpmWWnruiuMuyZJ6woKGuqrrSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html&text=What%20does%20Kitty%20Kitty%20Purr%20mean%3f%20Big%20Brother%2025s%20Blue%20Kim%20finally%20explains&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html&title=What%20does%20Kitty%20Kitty%20Purr%20mean%3f%20Big%20Brother%2025s%20Blue%20Kim%20finally%20explains" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html&title=What%20does%20Kitty%20Kitty%20Purr%20mean%3f%20Big%20Brother%2025s%20Blue%20Kim%20finally%20explains" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html&title=What%20does%20Kitty%20Kitty%20Purr%20mean%3f%20Big%20Brother%2025s%20Blue%20Kim%20finally%20explains" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-kitty-kitty-purr-mean-big-brother-25s-blue-kim-finally-explains.html&description=What%20does%20Kitty%20Kitty%20Purr%20mean%3f%20Big%20Brother%2025s%20Blue%20Kim%20finally%20explains" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./casey-close-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-401346-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Casey Close Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./star-wars-jedi-survivor-global-release-time-and-preload-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Star Wars Jedi Survivor: Global Release Time and Preload Date">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
