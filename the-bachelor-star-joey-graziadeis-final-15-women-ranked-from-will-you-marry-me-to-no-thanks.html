Based on the previews for episodes 4 and 5, it looks like Lexi gets the next one-on-one date, which will take place in the tiny and gorgeous Mediterranean nation of Malta. While it is impossible to know whether or not this date is smooth sailing for the duo, we can only infer that Joey and Lexi‚Äôs connection advances further and further, ultimately solidifying her spot as one of the frontrunners of the season.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false><strong>#3 ‚Äî Jennifer ‚ÄúJenn‚Äù Tran, a 25-year-old physician assistant student from Miami, Florida</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Bachelorette_-Jenn.png><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Serving as the only other individual who has embarked on a one-on-one date with The Bachelor himself, Jenn proved that she and Joey have something special.

While she has failed to receive as much screen time as some of her fellow contestants, the trailer for The Bachelor season 28 has teased that Rachel gets a one-on-one date (or two) sometime throughout the remainder of the season, leading us to assume that her connection with Joey will continue to advance.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false><strong>#6 ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Anderson</a>, a 25-year-old junior project manager from New Orleans, Louisiana</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Bachelor-Kelsey.png><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true>Praising Kelsey‚Äôs physical appearance over and over again ‚Äî constantly sharing in confessionals that she is drop dead gorgeous ‚Äî Joey and Kelsey seem to be slowly connecting on a deeper level, something that we can see growing into something more as the season progresses.

While it looks like there is definitely some sparks flying between Joey and Katelyn, it is still unclear where the pair goes from here ‚Äî with little to no spoilers in the trailer for season 28 ‚Äî ultimately causing her to fall in the center of our list.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false><strong>#8 ‚Äî Edwina Dorbor, a 25-year-old entrepreneur from Atlanta, Georgia</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Bachelorette_-Edwina.png><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>Much like Katelyn, Edwina has not had nearly as much screen time as her fellow contestants, however, there seems to be some flirtatiousness between her and Joey nonetheless.
