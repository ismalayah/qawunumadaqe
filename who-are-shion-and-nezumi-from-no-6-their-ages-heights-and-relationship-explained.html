For eight years, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No.6</a></strong> accompanied fans across Japan with the literary original work, which later received a manga adaptation illustrated by Hinoki Kino. Eight years after its first volume, the Japanese production company, Bones, worked tirelessly on bringing an anime adaptation of No.6 to the small screen. The series consisted of 11 episodes, depicting the life of those in the city known as “No.6.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>With an eerily intricate story, No.6 is anchored by Shion and Nezumi, two contrasting teenagers who grew up in divergent locations in the city. In a complete intertwining of fates, and a game of destiny, Nezumi and Shion meet for the very first time when they were children, proving that their differences are exactly what keeps their soul-bond connection indestructible. Almost poetically written to be opposites, their very appearance is a nod to their yin-yang nature, but how exactly do their appearances differ?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old are Shion and Nezumi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shion-nezumi-nr-6-3.jpg><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Nezumi and Shion meet for the first time at 12 years old. Although young in age, Nezumi was already wise beyond his years, albeit slightly traumatized, and Shion was already extremely intelligent and empathic — even towards strangers.</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Four years later, the two teenagers meet once again at 16 years old. With vastly different lives from when they were kids, Nezumi was now the one rescuing Shion and even saving him from the fatal parasitic wasp that would cause a widespread scar on the shorter boy’s face and body. The entire story develops, as Shion wishes to save the population from the infection, while Nezumi wishes for the exact opposite, but at just sixteen, both teenagers completely changed the course of the entire No.6.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-are-shion-and-nezumi-in-no-6 data-injectable=false>How tall are Shion and Nezumi in No.6?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shion-nezumi-nr-6.jpg><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>One of the many differences differentiating Nezumi and Shion’s appearance is their difference in height. Although both teenagers are close in age, they have vastly different physiques. In the manga or anime, neither of the differences are specified, as they are obvious to the eye of the beholder, however, the novel is much more attentive to detail. Both lead characters are thoroughly studied by their creator, who voluntarily includes details of the characters in the story.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>In the novel, Nezumi has been described as a slim and tall figure, towering over Shion for a few inches. The dark-haired teen is 5′ 10” (178cm), and despite his intimidating height, Nezumi is oftentimes described as feminine and even androgynous. He has a fair and pale complexion, contrasting with his grey eyes and black hair, and his androgyny is often overshadowed by his broad shoulders and well-defined muscles- as described by Shion.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>The white-haired boy is, in contrast, much shorter than his partner. Standing at 5′ 7″ (170cm), Shion is of a much smaller constitution than Nezumi. His slim figure makes him look much smaller than his height indicates, although he is not exactly emaciated. Initially, Shion’s white hair was actually brown, and his purple eyes were also a darker shade of brown, prior to the parasitic wasp affecting him with its substance.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Are Nezumi and Shion a couple?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/no6-shion-nezumi.jpg><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>A lingering question in every fan’s mind will always loom on the basis of romance. Oftentimes, describing their interactions poetically and almost romantically, there is no doubt that both teenagers have a lingering affection towards one another.</p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Nezumi and Shion are nothing but teenagers in a complicated universe that attempted to pit the two contrasting social scales against one another, but neither boy seems to pay any mind to the societal structure of No.6. Their soul-bond connection leads them to each other, solidifying their growing affection with two kisses throughout the story. Despite their physical declarations of tenderness, no explicit word regarding their relationship was ever uttered, as they remained friends with a clear romantic subtext. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nezumi’s words in the novel</a>, their feelings will never falter, regardless of whether he names them or not.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>On a more negative note, Asano has specified to not wish to call this story a BL (Boys’ Love). Instead, the author intends for No.6 to be known as a sci-fi post-apocalyptic universe, much like The Last of Us. For this reason, this manga often wrongly falls under the wrong label by fans. Showing a strong and unique relationship between two male characters, No.6 is still, at the end of the day, just a brilliant story of perseverance and freedom.</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=53 data-injectable=false>No.6 can be found and streamed on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlkaeybr%2FHoqanZZGjsW66xLOspqFdm7%2BwuYynpmZuXam1prXRZpignaNitaa1xqGrrGWRo7FuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html&text=Who%20are%20Shion%20and%20Nezumi%20from%20No.%206%3f%20Their%20ages%2c%20heights%2c%20and%20relationship%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html&title=Who%20are%20Shion%20and%20Nezumi%20from%20No.%206%3f%20Their%20ages%2c%20heights%2c%20and%20relationship%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html&title=Who%20are%20Shion%20and%20Nezumi%20from%20No.%206%3f%20Their%20ages%2c%20heights%2c%20and%20relationship%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html&title=Who%20are%20Shion%20and%20Nezumi%20from%20No.%206%3f%20Their%20ages%2c%20heights%2c%20and%20relationship%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-shion-and-nezumi-from-no-6-their-ages-heights-and-relationship-explained.html&description=Who%20are%20Shion%20and%20Nezumi%20from%20No.%206%3f%20Their%20ages%2c%20heights%2c%20and%20relationship%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./4-black-panther-characters-who-could-make-a-shock-return-in-ironheart.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="4 Black Panther characters who could make a shock return in Ironheart">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./salt-life-founder-michael-hutto-biography-net-worth-wikipedia-wife-and-arrest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Salt Life Founder Michael Hutto Biography, Net Worth: Wikipedia, Wife, And Arrest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
